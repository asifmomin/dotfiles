# Credits & Inspiration

## Primary Inspiration

This dotfiles configuration was heavily inspired by [Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy) by Basecamp.

**What we learned from Omarchy:**
- Minimal configuration philosophy
- Trusting tool defaults
- Performance-first approach
- Clean, readable configs
- Essential functionality only

**What we extended:**
- Cross-platform support (macOS/Linux/WSL)
- Modern development workflows (direnv, SOPS)
- Team collaboration features
- XDG compliance
- Unified Tokyo Night theming
